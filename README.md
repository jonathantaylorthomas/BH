# BH

BH is a C++ project for the Blizzard Ent. game Diablo II. This project was originally authored by McGod of Blizzhackers.cc (now offline) and was updated to current patch 1.14d. This program is not to be used on official battle.net servers and is only updated as a tool for learning. We're not responsible for the consequences if you ignore this advice. Enjoy :)
